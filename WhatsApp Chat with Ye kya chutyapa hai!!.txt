06/10/2015, 23:25 - Champions: “I lived in Mosul for five months under ISIS. I tried to avoid trouble but one of my neighbors reported me for shaving my beard. They came to my house while I was sleeping. My mother answered the door and they pushed her out of the way and dragged me out of bed. They asked me why I’d shaved my beard. I didn’t know what to tell them. They dragged me into the center of the city and made me kneel next to five other men. They called out on loudspeakers for everyone to come and watch. A large crowd gathered. The faces in the crowd seemed sad but they had no choice but to watch. ‘These men are atheists,’ they said. ‘And they will be punished.’ They took off my shirt and put a blindfold on me. They said that anyone who tried to go to the hospital afterward would be killed. I was the fifth one to be whipped. I could hear the men before me scream out in strange voices. When the first lash hit me, the pain was so bad that it felt like my soul left my body. They lashed me twelve times. I lost consciousness before it ended and woke up in bed.” (Salzburg, Austria)

15/10/2015, 09:13 - Champions: After garnering only 63 minutes in the second edition of the Indian Super League (ISL), Mumbai City FC have let go of their star player on Wednesday.

The Brazilian midfielder was amongst the two foreign players retained by the club apart from marquee player-manager Nicolas Anelka.

Moritz didn’t have the best of starts against the Deccan side and has substituted for Selim Benachour in the 63rd minute.

It is reliably learnt by Goal that the former Bolton midfielder wasn’t too happy with Anelka’s decision and after a brief altercation, the two parties were not on talking terms.

As a consequence Anelka chose to travel to Kochi with only 17 players in his squad as Moritz was left out of the team.

It remains unlikely that the Mumbai club will be allowed to sign a replacement as ISL rules deem it mandatory for the player to be out for the rest of the season due to an injury, which isn’t the case with Moritz.

“We would hereby like to announce that due to some personal emergency which requires him to go back home immediately, Andre Moritz will not be with us to play for the rest of the Hero ISL 2015. Upon his request, we are relieving him from team duties for the rest of the season. The team wishes him the very best,” read the official statement from Mumbai City FC CEO, Indranil Das Blah.

26/10/2015, 09:36 - Shivprasad Nair: Bhosadike.....😎

It may surprise you to know that the origin of the phrase "Bhosadike"
 is, in fact, an ancient Sanskrit greeting. "भो सद् इके?" meaning,
"Sir, are you well?"

'भो' is a term used for respectful greeting. Similar to अहो, जैसे..... भो भो बालकाः श्रूयताम.

'सद्' is a prefix used for 'Good Things'. As in सद् गुरु, सद् आचार, सद् भावना etc.

'इका' is a atmanepadi verb meaning 'To Be'. Other forms of this are:

इकते इकेते इकन्ते
इकसे इकेथे इकध्वे
इके इकावहे इकामहे

Hence "Bhosadike" was a popular form of greeting in ancient India before the Mughals invaded India & prohibited it for some reason.

However some steadfast Indians  continued to use this greeting. 

Therefore, to asassinate this greeting morally, the Mughals gave it profane & vulgar connotations, which unfortunately prevail even to this day 😕.

It is time we revived our ancient Indian traditions heeding to the call of the purists to go back to our ancient way of life.

So say "Bhosadike" to all the people you meet & explain to them its true, pure meaning.

13/11/2015, 02:23 - Srirag: Once upon a time ..a small boy named Basheer lived in a tiny Moroccan village. All his classmates hated him for his stupidity especially his teacher who was always yelling at him "you are driving me crazy Basheer"...
One day his mother went to check out how he is doing at school and the teacher told her honestly that her son is simply a disaster, getting very low marks and never had she seen such a dumb boy in her whole career...
The mother could not accept such a feed back and she took her son out from that school. she even shifted to another city ...
25 years later, that teacher got a cardio disorder and all the doctors have advised her to go for an open heart operation which only one surgeon could perform..
Left with no other choice she did it and the surgery was successful ...when she opened her eyes, she saw a handsome doctor smiling to her, being under anesthesia effect, she wanted to thank him but could not talk, in turn, he was staring at her face which started turning blue, she was raising her hand trying to tell him some thing but in vain and eventually died...
The doctor was shocked and was trying to understand what just happened, till he turned back and saw our friend Basheer working as a cleaner in that hospital who unplugged the ventilator to connect his vacuum cleaner......
If you were thinking that Basheer became a doctor, its because you have been watching too many Indian movies, serials or have read too many motivational foward messages...
Basheer is Basheer.

I  am prassana venkatram working as a system analyst for an American software company in Chennai. Presently drawing 18 lakhs P.A. proud owner of a 3BHK in suburbs of Chennai. Today I have 2 credit cards with more than 1 lakh credit limit and a bank balance of 65 thousand in my account. But due to heavy water logging I am not able to move out my house, all I need is water and food for my survival. Till yesterday I was worried about my appraisal and was expecting at least 15% hike but today I am standing in my terrace waiting for a food packet.

15/12/2015, 18:47 - Akash Gore: Many years ago, a Lawyer teacher came across a student who was willing to learn but was unable to pay the fees. The student struck a deal saying, "I will pay your fee the day I win my first case in the court".

Teacher agreed and proceeded with the law course. When the course was finished and teacher started pestering the student to pay up the fee, the student reminded him of the deal and pushed days.

Fed up with this, the teacher decided to sue the student in the court of law and both of them decided to argue for themselves.

The teacher put forward his argument saying:
"If I win this case, as per the court of law, the student has to pay me as the case is about his non-payment of dues.
And if I lose the case, the student will still pay me because he would have won his first case...
So either way I will get the money".

Equally brilliant, the student argued back saying:
"If I win the case, as per the court of law, I don't have to pay anything to the teacher as the case is about my non-payment of dues.
And if I lose the case, I don't have to pay him because I haven't won my first case yet....
So either way, I am not going to pay the teacher anything".

This is one of the greatest paradoxes ever recorded.

Who is right and who is the winner?

This is part of ancient Greek history. The lawyer teacher was Protagoras (c.485-415 BCE) and the student was Euthalos. 

This is known as Protagoras's Paradox. This case was not solved. The most interesting part - this is still debated (even today) in law schools as a logic problem
15/12/2015, 20:09 - Champions: This is a very stupid paradox
15/12/2015, 20:10 - Champions: You can't hold given true one at a time...as per the convinience...

15/12/2015, 20:12 - Akash Gore: Now which one do u hold true at one point as a judge to decied
15/12/2015, 20:12 - Akash Gore: Thats the paradox
15/12/2015, 20:13 - Champions: Student 1st case mein law abiding hai...2nd case mein his statement abiding
15/12/2015, 20:13 - Champions: He is doing it as per convenience
15/12/2015, 20:15 - Champions: The case is about 'non payment of dues'.... Not about student not honoring his statement

15/12/2015, 23:13 - Lalit Patil: Level because good players play shit. Average players play good. And club supporters blind to say others play good when the fact is they play shit class. Unlike old EPL times.
15/12/2015, 23:13 - Srirag: U can agrue on that but frankly the quality has dropped
15/12/2015, 23:13 - Akash Gore: 5 point lead mila nai ki title race over

15/12/2015, 23:13 - Champions: One way traffic
15/12/2015, 23:14 - Lalit Patil: Its just the inertia of EPL football fans that keeps it the best spirited tournament.
15/12/2015, 23:14 - Akash Gore: But even when madrid or barca r shit la liga teams rarely defeat them
15/12/2015, 23:14 - Akash Gore: Epl mein a slump is noticd

15/12/2015, 23:16 - Champions: Sucks big time
15/12/2015, 23:16 - Lalit Patil: You see barca win since 10 years. Like Roger in tennis ruled but people saw observed and got him down. What is different about barca and real is they consistently improve every year and even though people see all the games they can't find a flaw.
15/12/2015, 23:16 - Akash Gore: Improve nai..buy
15/12/2015, 23:16 - Champions: La liga is exhibition of football not competition

15/12/2015, 23:19 - Lalit Patil: Win win win is entrepreneurship or money laundering business.

15/12/2015, 23:20 - Lalit Patil: Football game spirit is defined by fair games. Non crybaby strategies unlike MadarMuriniho. And some magic and new skills to entertain the people.
15/12/2015, 23:20 - Shivprasad Nair: Ha..... Kuch bhi ho skta

16/12/2015, 00:01 - Champions: Patrick Kluivert goal
16/12/2015, 08:15 - Akash Gore: But despite the flames burning beneath his feet, Mourinho is seemingly prepared only to blame everybody but himself. Referees have borne the brunt of his frustrations, as have players, doctors, the media and, at Leicester, the King Power Stadium ball-boys who were, in Mourinho’s words, “a disgrace for the Premier League”.

Chelsea’s players, according to Mourinho, only won the title last season because “I did phenomenal work and brought them to a level that is not their level”.  And so Mourinho, the Special One, is now steering a ship on to the rocks because he is failing to repeat that trick this season.
16/12/2015, 08:16 - Akash Gore: Mourinho’s remarks at Leicester felt like those of a man desperate to hurl a final insult at his detractors before he is turfed out of the door.

18/12/2015, 07:27 - Champions: Which is the most cherished moment of your WWE career?

Khali"Obviously , winning the World Heavyweight Championship was a memorable moment but nothing tops the feeling of defeating the Undertaker. It announced my arrival to the world. People were curious to know who this man is who routed the Undertaker."
Outside the ring, what was your equation with the Undertaker and others like?

"First of all, whatever you get to see on TV is completely real. The pain the fighters feel and the blood they shed are all real. The injuries that we sustain... I doubt that any sportsperson in the world would have received so many injuries. Similarly , the rivalry that you see on stage is also real. So, while the equation between two players might be cordial outside the ring, that doesn't mean they are friends. The grudge from the match remains."

Company's Memo to its Indian Staff

This is a REAL MEMO from a HR Director in Redmond, WA to its staff of Indian Origin. Every word here is kept intact without alteration.

MEMO TO INDIAN 

TO ALL HINDI-SPEAKING STAFF

It has been brought to our attention by several officials visiting our corporate headquarters that offensive language is commonly used by our Hindi-speaking staff. Such behavior, in addition to violating our policy, is highly unprofessional and offensive to both visitors and colleagues.

Staff will IMMEDIATELY adhere to the following rules:

1. Words like CHUTIYA, GANDU and other such expressions will not be used for emphasis, no matter how heated the discussion. You will not say CHUTIYE, AKKAL NAHI HAI KYA TEREKO when someone makes a mistake, or MADAR CHOD, BHENCHOD when a major mistake
has been made. All forms derived from the verb CHOD are inappropriate in our environment.

2. No project manager, section head or administrator, under any circumstances, will be referred to as GADHA or CHUTIYA. Lack of determination will not be referred to as KAAMCHOR SAALA and neither will persons who lack initiative be referred to as BHOSADIKAA or MADARCHOD.

3. Unusual or creative ideas from your superiors are not to be referred to as GAND FAADU, if a person is persistent, or if a task is heavy to accomplish. In a similar way, do not use GAND FATI, if a colleague is going through a difficult situation.

4. Furthermore, you must not say BHOSADE MEIN GAYA when matters become complicated. When asking someone to leave you alone, you must not say DIMAG KI MAA BHEN MAT KAR. Do not ever substitute 'May I help you?' with BOL TERI GAND KAISE MARU.

5. When things get tough, an acceptable_expression such as 'We are going through a difficult time' should be used, rather than MAA CHUDI PADI HAI or GOTI MUH MEIN HAI..

6. No salary increase shall be ever referred to as KHAIRAAT BAATI JAA RAHI HAI KYA. Under no circumstances should you call our elderly corporate partners as BUDDHA KHOOSAT.

7. Last, but not least, after reading this memo, please do not say: YE KAGAJ GAND PONCHNE KE LAAYAK BHI NAHI HAI.
We hope you will keep these directions in mind.



Sincerely,
Steve Rider

11/01/2016, 17:49 - Akash Gore: "I'm a big enemy of the Ballon d'Or,” Wenger said. “Who will win it? You know as well as I do that it will be Messi. Barcelona won everything this year."
11/01/2016, 17:56 - Lalit Patil: If someone played better from arsenal team he would have won it. Doesn't matter team wins where and shiz.
11/01/2016, 17:57 - Akash Gore: Though its always awarded to the playr of the team who wins the most
11/01/2016, 17:57 - Lalit Patil: Naturally if that happened the team would have won somewhere. So that is that.
11/01/2016, 17:57 - Lalit Patil: Cause its natural
11/01/2016, 17:57 - Akash Gore: Not necessarily
11/01/2016, 17:57 - Lalit Patil: The team with beat player will probably win something
11/01/2016, 17:57 - Lalit Patil: Best*
11/01/2016, 17:58 - Akash Gore: Once messi was the highest scorer..madrid won everythin n ronaldo was equally brilliant..yet messi won
11/01/2016, 17:58 - Akash Gore: And also his 2nd balon d or..yaad nai..koi to inter ka playr tha i guess
11/01/2016, 17:58 - Akash Gore: Who ppl thought would win hands down
11/01/2016, 17:59 - Akash Gore: Its messi this time..hands down though
11/01/2016, 17:59 - Akash Gore: 🙏🏻
11/01/2016, 18:00 - Lalit Patil: Yeah people just get butt hurt. Nothing unusual.
11/01/2016, 18:01 - Akash Gore: Not true..
11/01/2016, 18:01 - Lalit Patil: This season toh without doubt its messi. No one could have played better
11/01/2016, 18:01 - Akash Gore: The last time ronaldo was bettr than messi ppl startd using neur ka naam
11/01/2016, 18:01 - Akash Gore: Sab lobbyin pe hai ye awards
11/01/2016, 18:02 - Akash Gore: Playr of the world cup..messi😂😂laughable
11/01/2016, 18:02 - Lalit Patil: People want to see drama dude. I don't get it why they don't watch good thriller movies or wwe to aid their cause.
11/01/2016, 18:02 - Akash Gore: Playr votin ye wo chutzpah
11/01/2016, 18:02 - Akash Gore: Sab apne apne playr ko vote karte hai
11/01/2016, 18:03 - Akash Gore: N personal favorites
11/01/2016, 18:03 - Lalit Patil: Don't know the technical details how they come up with a winner
11/01/2016, 18:04 - Akash Gore: Koi fair voting nai karta..barca ka coach will put all top 3 as barca players
11/01/2016, 18:04 - Akash Gore: N madrid ka would do same
11/01/2016, 18:04 - Lalit Patil: But preferences is an integral part of human nature. It applies to all fields and everywhere.
11/01/2016, 18:04 - Akash Gore: All national team captains coaches
11/01/2016, 18:04 - Akash Gore: And journalists
11/01/2016, 18:04 - Akash Gore: Vote
11/01/2016, 18:04 - Akash Gore: Top 3
11/01/2016, 18:05 - Akash Gore: 1st rank pe 5 points,2nd rank pe 3,3rd pe 1 point
11/01/2016, 18:05 - Akash Gore: Last mein jis playr ka highest points wo win
11/01/2016, 18:06 - Lalit Patil: I always saw deserving player win it though. At least for past five years.
11/01/2016, 18:06 - Akash Gore: So now for an example Even though everyone knows messi ronaldo neymar is the order of best players this yr..barca coach would give ronaldo as 3rd
11/01/2016, 18:06 - Akash Gore: So usko points kam mileva
11/01/2016, 18:07 - Akash Gore: And vice versa for madrid coach
11/01/2016, 18:07 - Akash Gore: Portugal coach would keep ronaldo first and his closest rival as 3rd n not 2nd..to ensure ronaldo wins
11/01/2016, 18:07 - Akash Gore: Etc
11/01/2016, 18:08 - Lalit Patil: So things are square
11/01/2016, 18:08 - Lalit Patil: Cause every player will have his own coach
11/01/2016, 18:08 - Akash Gore: Top 3 narrow down mein bakchodi hota hai
11/01/2016, 18:09 - Lalit Patil: If things worked that simple. We could solve and get a solution on piece of paper.
11/01/2016, 18:09 - Akash Gore: South america countries waale suarez ko vote nai diye honge..enemies honge usko
11/01/2016, 18:09 - Akash Gore: Not necessarily fair..whoever lobies better basically
11/01/2016, 18:09 - Lalit Patil: I don't deny there is no politics.
11/01/2016, 18:09 - Akash Gore: Not as a plyr lobby..real madrid would lobby for ronaldo..barca for messi
11/01/2016, 18:10 - Lalit Patil: But I think result always end up favouring the deserving player.
11/01/2016, 18:10 - Akash Gore: Recent yrs mein agree
11/01/2016, 18:10 - Akash Gore: Fair results

11/01/2016, 18:11 - Akash Gore: Yet..those 2 have been at the podium since ages man!!
11/01/2016, 18:11 - Lalit Patil: Ronaldo ko Madrid sideline karke galti kar raha hai

11/01/2016, 18:11 - Lalit Patil: That is the fucking problem
11/01/2016, 18:11 - Akash Gore: He should leave madrid graciously
11/01/2016, 18:12 - Akash Gore: Before another casillas happens
11/01/2016, 18:12 - Akash Gore: And then screw madrid in the CL
11/01/2016, 18:12 - Lalit Patil: Ronaldo playing good dude
11/01/2016, 18:12 - Lalit Patil: He still is consistent
11/01/2016, 18:12 - Akash Gore: Obviously
11/01/2016, 18:12 - Akash Gore: Top pe hi niklo madrid se
11/01/2016, 18:12 - Akash Gore: Is my point
11/01/2016, 18:13 - Akash Gore: Before a casillas happens
11/01/2016, 18:13 - Lalit Patil: I'd rather bench bale modric Ramos and James maybe. Someone among these
11/01/2016, 18:13 - Lalit Patil: Ronaldo is still the man. No one can take his position.
11/01/2016, 18:14 - Akash Gore: Ronaldo mu pe bolta hai..m not gonna retire at sub standard leagues like MLS,qatar etc
11/01/2016, 18:14 - Akash Gore: 😂
11/01/2016, 18:14 - Akash Gore: He doesnt c them as his nxt move
11/01/2016, 18:14 - Akash Gore: Mayb EPL or PSG
11/01/2016, 18:15 - Akash Gore: If EPL there is only one team he is coming too.. !!
11/01/2016, 18:15 - Lalit Patil: Haha he won't anytime soon
11/01/2016, 18:16 - Akash Gore: Especially seeing manutd like this
11/01/2016, 18:16 - Akash Gore: Van raand
11/01/2016, 18:17 - Lalit Patil: RM players who you cannot bench : Ronaldo Marcelo. Integral players. James is also very consistent and down to earth.
11/01/2016, 18:18 - Lalit Patil: Barca players you cannot bench : 
Dani alves
Busquites
Neymar in current form
Mascherano
11/01/2016, 18:18 - Lalit Patil: These are the real dudes. Other places will just be filled by whoever new plays and shines good
11/01/2016, 18:21 - Akash Gore: Even ramos
11/01/2016, 18:21 - Akash Gore: Messi saale
11/01/2016, 18:37 - Lalit Patil: Messi yes. Ramos abhi thoda fail khel raha hai
11/01/2016, 19:07 - Champions: Ronaldo will always be doomed by his ego, attitude... No humbleness found in him....
That's why his glory will always be laced with fans, criticizing alike.
And that's not a crime.

Not everyone can be Messi or Tendulkar
11/01/2016, 19:10 - Lalit Patil: Ronaldo is a privilege enough to have all the attitude.
11/01/2016, 19:11 - Lalit Patil: God player
11/01/2016, 19:42 - Champions: That's the difference between great sportsman and Idol
11/01/2016, 19:43 - Akash Gore: Not really..depends on whom u chose as ur idol
11/01/2016, 19:43 - Akash Gore: He has attitude..he is not a bad man to not chose as ur idol
11/01/2016, 19:44 - Akash Gore: Does not racially abuse or u know things like that
11/01/2016, 19:45 - Champions: Humbleness is a quality graced by few
11/01/2016, 19:45 - Akash Gore: If u look at what he does outside the pitch..i dont c a think that makes him a less of a idol than messi or any other
11/01/2016, 19:45 - Akash Gore: Agreed..so ?
11/01/2016, 19:45 - Champions: U are good...everyone knows u are good....why u need to keep saying that
11/01/2016, 19:45 - Akash Gore: Why should humbleness be a criteria for being a idol
11/01/2016, 19:46 - Akash Gore: When u reach that level..who knows..that attitude drives him to remain there
11/01/2016, 19:46 - Akash Gore: Without attitude ronaldo wouldnt b ronaldo
11/01/2016, 19:47 - Lalit Patil: Maybe his claim in public is his fame formula
11/01/2016, 19:48 - Akash Gore: He thinks he is the best..doesnt stop working though
11/01/2016, 19:48 - Lalit Patil: Like a man claims he will do it. He has to do it after telling 100 people in front of him. Maybe that is what drives him.
11/01/2016, 19:48 - Akash Gore: Doesnt allow it to get to his head
11/01/2016, 19:48 - Akash Gore: Doesnt that get defined as greatness
11/01/2016, 19:49 - Akash Gore: Exactly..he tells it..takes in the world n still does it day in and day out..and that drives ppl crazy who r waiting for a chance to get back at him
11/01/2016, 19:49 - Lalit Patil: But humbleness is a quality possessed by legends.
11/01/2016, 19:49 - Lalit Patil: Let's call ronaldo an exception
11/01/2016, 19:49 - Akash Gore: Kya pata..pele etc .. I dont find them humble
11/01/2016, 19:50 - Akash Gore: Sachin ka contrast is virat kohli..but kohli abuses n shit..thats not what ronaldo does

11/01/2016, 19:53 - Lalit Patil: Messi is humble and he wins hearts naturally. Ronaldo is not humble but he will force your heart to surrender.

11/01/2016, 22:49 - Champions: Ballon dor formality ho gaya hai bas....
11/01/2016, 22:49 - Champions: Both Messi and Ronaldo were asked which quality they would take from each other, and the Portugal international admitted: “Yes, his left foot his really good, I would like to have that!”

Messi, meanwhile, was a bit more vague.

“What Cristiano has is lots of quality, lots of good things that every player would like as well,” said the Barcelona forward.

“But I am the way I am, and he is the way he is. We each have individual personalities and we have both very good things that everybody should have as footballers.”

Neymar was a bit more humble and admitted he would like to have feet from both Messi and Ronaldo.
11/01/2016, 22:51 - Akash Gore: Chabaya messi
11/01/2016, 22:51 - Champions: Haan

12/01/2016, 18:29 - Akash Gore: http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/ballon-dor-voting-who-picked-lionel-messi-who-picked-cristiano-ronaldo-and-who-picked-de-bruyne-a6807351.html
12/01/2016, 18:39 - Akash Gore: Lalit:
12/01/2016, 18:39 - Akash Gore: Messi was the overwhelming favourite to win the award after inspiring Barcelona to another historic treble last season.

In 56 appearances in 2015, the South American genius scored 48 goals - standard Messi stats - giving him a goals-to-games average of 0.86.
12/01/2016, 18:39 - Akash Gore: Messi also provided 24 assists for his teammates - an average of 0.43 assists per game - while his shot conversation ratio was a pretty impressive 21.4 per cent.
12/01/2016, 18:39 - Akash Gore: RONALDO'S INDIVIDUAL STATS WERE BETTER...

In terms of individual stats, Ronaldo boasted the best figures of the three Ballon d’Or finalists.

The Portuguese star made 52 appearances for Los Blancos and weighed in with a staggering 54 goals, plus 17 assists.
12/01/2016, 18:40 - Akash Gore: So if u say Balon De Or shouldnt be given as per team trophies..look who better stats
12/01/2016, 18:40 - Akash Gore: But Messi got the nod from those with the power to vote on account of the major team trophies he won with Barcelona and his influence in the decisive matches.

Goals, it turns out, aren’t everything when it comes to the Ballon d’Or.
12/01/2016, 18:41 - Champions: Yep...team results obviously matter
12/01/2016, 18:42 - Akash Gore: Yep..same as how today's man of the match was smith..149 runs..n not rohit sharma 171*
12/01/2016, 18:42 - Champions: Righto
12/01/2016, 18:43 - Akash Gore: 52 games 54 goals and 17 assists🙏🏻

12/01/2016, 18:47 - Champions: Real k case mein...its still majorly ronaldo
12/01/2016, 18:47 - Akash Gore: Whereas its all ronaldo n benzema
12/01/2016, 18:48 - Akash Gore: <Media omitted>
12/01/2016, 18:48 - Akash Gore: Because of which they tend not not win many titles..
12/01/2016, 19:01 - Champions: <Media omitted>
12/01/2016, 19:51 - Lalit Patil: Ronaldo has a bigger count cause he scored 5 5 goals against relegation club or a 9 man team
12/01/2016, 19:51 - Lalit Patil: S*
12/01/2016, 19:51 - Lalit Patil: Also he usually never scores in crucial matches. Not saying he doesn't play up good in these matches but "score"
12/01/2016, 19:53 - Akash Gore: Never scored in 2015 in crucial matches mayb
12/01/2016, 19:53 - Akash Gore: But cant say never scores in crucial matches !!
12/01/2016, 19:55 - Akash Gore: N nobody told messi not to score 5 5 goals against relegation teams

12/01/2016, 19:58 - Akash Gore: Goal tally ka pichu pikachu award milta hai anyways
12/01/2016, 19:58 - Akash Gore: Team success jitna madrid ko milta hai wo ronaldo ki wajah se hi milta hai
12/01/2016, 19:58 - Nimish Kulkarni: Next year toh ronaldo top 3 me bhi nai rahega
12/01/2016, 19:58 - Akash Gore: Just that they dont end up winning like barca because of club chutzpah

They emerged from the meeting so confident of winning their appeal, they decided not to rush through signings during this January window, which is excluded  from the ban, and wait until the summer to make a move for De Gea.

Ramires, who joined Chelsea for 18 million pounds ($ 25.6 million) in 2010, just signed a new four-year deal in October, reports Xinhua.

The 28-year-old Brazil international will become the most expensive player in Chinese football history if he completes the move.

A farmer is on the hill top  with his herd....

A helicopter suddenly lands and a handsome youth comes out.
He approaches the farmer with a swagger and tells him, "if I can tell you accurately the number of cows u have wil u allow me to take one of your calves?"

FARMER thinks and says okay.

The young man presses an app on his smartphone and gets the satellite image on dharwad.indicate where he is, he then sends his co - ordinates to ISRO- which then photographs the area for him. he then calls ISRO to identify all living things in the radius of the hill top and gets an answer 35. He deducts 2 and tells farmer...
you have 33 cows.

Farmer says ok you can have one of my calves.

As the young man is trying to load the animal on to his helicopter, the FARMER says; "if I tell u r name will u return my calf?"

The young guy says ok.

The farmer says : U r RAHUL GANDHI. 

The young man is shocked😳, he says, "how did you know ?"

Farmer says, " its Easy, u came here when no one invited you, u used millions of tax payers money to give me information which I have known for years" 

By the way these are sheep not cows and could u please return my dog...😂😂😂

Manchester City can confirm that in recent weeks it has commenced and finalized contractual negotiations with Pep Guardiola to become MCFC Head Coach for the 16/17 EPL season onwards. The contract is for three years. These negotiations were a re-commencement of discussions that were curtailed in 2012.

Out of respect for Manuel Pellegrini and the players, the Club wishes to make its decision public to remove the unnecessary burden of speculation. Manuel Pellegrini, who is fully supportive of the decision to make this communication, is entirely focused on achieving his targets for the season ahead and retains the respect and commitment of all involved with the leadership of the club.

06/02/2016, 20:35 - Srirag: From Arsnel's point of view the result was good
06/02/2016, 21:22 - Champions: When i look at this match ( Leicester City vs Manchester City), i see a bunch of players that has worked hard all their football career. Vardy was dropped by Sheffield Wednesday when he was teenager,  Mahrez was to skinny for Sarcelles, Huth didn't make it in Chelsea. Schmeichel had to fight (hard to make it when you have a Father that is a legend)
Drinkwater didn't make it in United. These players have similar history, fighting to become something despite being told that they're not good enough. If Leicester win the League its not just a historical victory for The team but also a victory for football. LEICESTER are showing the world that you can win even if your players are cheaper than the other players In the big teams.

13/02/2016, 19:26 - Champions: Beware of fraud shop in Raghuleela Mall at Vashi. 

Last Monday on 26th January, we have visited shop of ice cream at first floor in Raghuleela Mall name '' Tutty Fruitty Frozen Tastebuds''

When we sat on chair one lady came up with menu card when I have asked her where is price chart she ignore it, still we managed and asked for 3 ice creams of choco island sun and 1 strawberry love small cup for kid. 
The quality of ice cream was so poor so we have not finished till the end and we have asked for bill. A lady came with bill worth 1407/- and when I have asked how is it possible only 3 cone and 1 small cup worth this much an lady was smiling behind counter boy & Girl as like they have made intensionally mistake and they want to stole money from us. They literally made us fool. A five star hotel will not charge such handsome amount for these type of ice creams. 1 cone worth 400/- and 1 small cone worth 210/- 

After argument with her she finally showed price list where actual price list and billed price has variation of 100 Rs each it meance 400/- extra they made. 

When I have asked her why the rate variation in it, she without hesitation told that being holiday we used to charge extra amount on each product. Still I have asked where is notice board of it she told there is no as such notice chart it's our policy. 

Really fraud they are !!

Matter is not for money but the way they fool people we should ban on such shops. Give quality and then ask for such amount.

Please share this post with most of the people so that we can save ourself from such fraud shops.

15/02/2016, 10:42 - Akash Gore: Why not arsenal?
15/02/2016, 10:42 - Sagar Kesarwani: Arsenal too
15/02/2016, 10:54 - Srirag: Leicester deser the most because they have shown what hardwork n consistency can do, you don't need money or legacy like United n Liverpool to fight to be at top. One season back we wouldn't have even watched Arsnel vs Leicester match cause every one knows it would have been an ez game for Arsnel. Arsnel is the same as every season playing catch up game not consistent to be at top of the table and eventually settle at 3rd or 4th position. If it wouldn't have been for the red card yesterday Leicester owned them hard time. Tottenham for the fact that they don't have much of big names like Arsnel n City still have had such good away form to come at no 2 and be in a good winning form. Their game play is great not as boring as United.
15/02/2016, 11:10 - Champions: 👍🏻👍🏻
15/02/2016, 11:10 - Champions: Leicester.....Go foxes

15/02/2016, 15:20 - Sagar Kesarwani: Dude,that's because Leicester was one man down
15/02/2016, 15:24 - Champions: I said they played well....but against 1 man down...that is expected
15/02/2016, 15:45 - Shivprasad Nair: Dekh

15/02/2016, 16:36 - Akash Gore: Why should it be?
15/02/2016, 16:37 - Akash Gore: as soon as u kick it..it is in play and others can play on..suarez was the first to the loose ball n he scored
15/02/2016, 16:37 - Sagar Kesarwani: Ok

15/02/2016, 16:38 - Akash Gore: Plus neymar went onto say ki that pass wasnt meant for suarez it was meant for neymar as messi n neymar had practised this routine in practise

15/02/2016, 23:00 - Akash Gore: Here's what a manutd fan said
15/02/2016, 23:00 - Akash Gore: If United tried that penalty, Rooney would pass to Martial, who'd then pass it to Carrick, then on to Smalling and back to De Gea.

16/02/2016, 19:56 - Champions: But under Roman u do expect this....
16/02/2016, 19:56 - Champions: Lampard also had a season left in him....
16/02/2016, 20:08 - Akash Gore: Kya bolta lalit..messi penalty..brilliance or arrogance?
16/02/2016, 20:09 - Akash Gore: Wo log ko bhi mann karta rahega na kuch alag goal maarneka

16/02/2016, 20:36 - Lalit Patil: Within rules, nothing wrong about it
16/02/2016, 20:37 - Sagar Kesarwani: Yeah....but morally not right
16/02/2016, 20:37 - Lalit Patil: Something new to see. Smart stuff.
16/02/2016, 20:37 - Lalit Patil: Morally?
16/02/2016, 20:37 - Shivprasad Nair: Lo

16/02/2016, 20:37 - Sagar Kesarwani: IMO
16/02/2016, 20:37 - Lalit Patil: Are you from fifaRSS?
16/02/2016, 20:37 - Sagar Kesarwani: Suarez ko dena hi tha to directly de deta
16/02/2016, 20:38 - Lalit Patil: There was nothing wrong about it
16/02/2016, 20:38 - Lalit Patil: Dude imagine he slipped and that happened
16/02/2016, 20:38 - Sagar Kesarwani: That's a different scenario bro
16/02/2016, 20:39 - Champions: I think penalty is too easy their should be 2 types short and long penalty

Long for not very serious fouls...to be taken from out of box.
Penalty is heavily misused in football
16/02/2016, 20:39 - Champions: There*
16/02/2016, 20:39 - Lalit Patil: Rules are same bro
16/02/2016, 20:39 - Lalit Patil: Defenders are sleeping and they did it
16/02/2016, 20:39 - Lalit Patil: It is just an indication that team had agreed upon a certain goal
16/02/2016, 20:40 - Lalit Patil: No one was even ready to move, the team believed that
16/02/2016, 20:40 - Champions: Aur aise penalty mein two strikers vs one gk is unfair....
16/02/2016, 20:40 - Champions: Gk and defender khada kar do fir
16/02/2016, 20:40 - Shivprasad Nair: Defndrs shud hav actd
16/02/2016, 20:40 - Lalit Patil: Whats the point us favoring the team when the defenders had given up
16/02/2016, 20:41 - Lalit Patil: I mean no one even took effort of trying to come back
16/02/2016, 20:41 - Lalit Patil: All four barca players came in
16/02/2016, 20:41 - Shivprasad Nair: Actually der was a greater chance to save it dn
16/02/2016, 20:41 - Lalit Patil: Defender could have saved it
16/02/2016, 20:41 - Champions: Chuck it...this penalty will fade away soon
16/02/2016, 20:41 - Champions: Not worth discusssing
16/02/2016, 20:41 - Sagar Kesarwani: 😂
16/02/2016, 20:41 - Lalit Patil: Cause it's fair when both defender and Suarez are outside box
16/02/2016, 20:42 - Lalit Patil: Equal distance for two
16/02/2016, 20:43 - Lalit Patil: No comments about this :/
16/02/2016, 20:45 - Lalit Patil: According to me greater disrespect to game is ten players coming and playing in D box once they score one goal and you know
16/02/2016, 20:45 - Lalit Patil: Pussies be like
16/02/2016, 20:46 - Lalit Patil: Anyway it is fair
16/02/2016, 20:46 - Champions: Tu ek hi macho...baaki sab pussies 😜

18/02/2016, 07:11 - Champions: Roy Keane slams Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard saying: 'If I was his team-mate, I'd kick him up and down the training pitch'

The former Manchester United midfielder said: ‘I can’t understand these players, he signed an extension of five years only last year, when we saw how brilliant he was… and then he’s coming out with all that nonsense on the eve of a big game.

‘If I was a team-mate of his I would kick him up and down the training pitch. Some of the senior players have got to get hold of him. He’s a talented boy, but his attitude is like a spoilt child. It was absolutely ridiculous.

28/02/2016, 21:44 - Srirag: This match proves my point of why Arsnel don't deserve to win. They simply can't do it, don't have that fighting spirit required of a champion. They were favourites to win this game but as usual they give it away. Great boost for Tottenham and Leicester
28/02/2016, 21:48 - Champions: Big boost for Leicester
28/02/2016, 21:49 - Champions: They just need to be wary of spurs
28/02/2016, 21:49 - Champions: Aresnal City outt

08/03/2016, 20:00 - Champions: U opened link?
08/03/2016, 20:01 - Champions: " Jose Mourinho is a big star. He’d been my manager at Inter. He’s nice. The first time he met my partner Helena, he whispered to her: ‘Helena, you have only one mission: feed Zlatan, let him sleep, keep him happy.’ That guy says whatever he wants. I like him. He’s the leader of his army. But he cares, too. He would text me all the time at Inter, wondering how I was doing. He’s the exact opposite of Pep Guardiola.

If Mourinho lights up a room, Guardiola draws the curtains. I guessed that Guardiola was trying to match up to him.

Mourinho would become a guy I was basically willing to die for."

17/03/2016, 00:57 - Nimish Kulkarni: A monkey is sitting in a tree, smoking a  joint, when a lizard walks past. The lizard looks up and says “Hey! what are you doing?” The monkey says “Smoking a joint, come  up and join me"


 So the lizard climbs up  and sits next to the monkey and they have another joint. After a while  the lizard says his mouth is ‘dry’, and that he’s going to get a drink  from the river.

 At the riverbank,  the lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls in. A  Crocodile sees this and swims over to the stoned lizard, helping him to  the side.

 He then asks the lizard, “What’s the matter with you?!”  The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting in the tree,  smoking a joint with the monkey and  his  mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a  drink from the river, he fell in!

 The inquisitive crocodile says he  has to check this out. He walks into the jungle and finds the tree where  the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint. 

He looks up and says “Hey,  MONKEY!” 

The Monkey looks down and says “FUUUUUCK, DUDE……. Tu kitna pani piya re laude????? #stonerquotes

07/04/2016, 21:12 - Srirag: There was a farmer who had a horse and a goat…..

One day, the horse became ill and he called the veterinarian, who said: Well, your horse has a virus. He must take this medicine for three days. I'll come back on the 3rd day and if he's not better, we're going to have to put him down.

Nearby, the goat listened closely to their conversation.

The next day, they gave him the medicine and left.

The goat approached the horse and said: - Be strong,  friend. Get up or else they're going to put you to sleep!

On the second day, they gave him the medicine and left.

The goat came back and said: - Come on buddy, get up or else you're going to die! Come on, I'll help you get up.
Let's go! One, two, three...

On the third day, they came to give him the medicine and the vet said:- Unfortunately, we're going to have to put him down tomorrow. Otherwise, the virus might spread and infect the other horses.

After they left, the goat approached the horse and said: Listen pal, it's now or never! Get up, come on! Have courage! Come on! Get up! Get up! That's it, slowly! Great! Come on, one, two, three... Good, good. Now faster, come on...... Fantastic! Run, run more!
Yes! Yay! Yes! You did it, you're a champion!!!

All of a sudden, the owner came back, saw the horse running in the field and began shouting: It's a miracle! My horse is cured. We must have a grand party. Let's Cook the goat!!!! 😳😭😷😢 

Lesson:
Whatever you do, always mark a CC to your boss. 😝😝😝

09/04/2016, 14:49 - Champions: Dear CSK fans,
We do understand the disappointment of not having 'your' team in this season of IPL. But honestly , we should appreciate tat action has been taken against them for the wrong doings. Also all their achievements have been belittled by their owners coz all their wins and loses are now under scrutiny.
Agreed they were a great team, but I disagree that they were the best. Thy won IPL twice, bus so did KKR and MI. In fact head to head MI leads 14-11 against them.
As for fan following , it was MSD but then so is SRT or SOURAV OR RAHUL. So let's stop portraying them as 'THE ' team... and get on with the game.
Yours sincerely 
A Mumbai Indian

15/04/2016, 19:09 - Champions: FA cups final for 6 consecutive times....chelsea academy is upto something
15/04/2016, 19:50 - Champions: Real Madrid and Chelsea had come to a agreement for the Belgium international. The price was a cut rate deal of around £32 million for Hazard.

£32 million should be your first clue.

Even in his bad form, he's worth more than that. It's no secret that Zidane is in love with the Belgian but that doesn't mean he's headed to the Bernabéu. Hazard isn't one for the media and tries to avoid interviews if he can, so for him to come out and say publicly he's staying means a lot.

They’re still in Castle Black, and he hasn’t been killed by a White Walker either.”

26/04/2016, 07:20 - Champions: A goalkeeper has been sent off after just 11 seconds to become one of the fastest to ever be dismissed in English football.

Nicky Seekings, a striker by trade, stepped between the posts for Ashton Villa - not a typo - after regular No.1 Joe Griffiths was unavailable due to commitments as a male model. Yep.

So the 32-year-old was thrust into an unfamiliar role and did not fare too well, felling Ingol Rangers striker Lee Ashcroft inside the penalty with just 11 seconds on the clock and without touching the ball.

"I'm normally a striker but when I turned up they asked me to go in nets," Seekings told the Lancashire Evening Post. "Our normal goalkeeper Joe is really good but had to miss the game because he was modelling.

28/04/2016, 07:19 - Champions: In February, Loftus-Cheek signed a new five-year contract with Chelsea worth a reported £60,000 per week. The 20-year old midfielder was already on a deal worth £32,000 per week. Prolific academy striker Dominic Solanke, yet to start a first team game for Chelsea, has spent this season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem where he has scored seven goals in 24 games. The 18-year old Solanke, who scored in the finals of last year's FA Youth Cup and UEFA Youth League, is currently embroiled in contract negotiations, as he seeks to improve £7,000 a week terms to a staggering £50,000 per week.

To put the above salaries in perspective, In February, established England and Tottenham Hotspur star Harry Kane signed a new £45,000 per week five-and-a-half year deal at White Hart Lane. The emergence of prodigious Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford draws parallels with the initial impact Kane made at Spurs. What is truly remarkable about the 18-year old Rashford is that his wages of £500 per week as a Red Devils youth player pale into insignificance compared to what Solanke earns at Chelsea. The incentive-based salary scheme at Old Trafford could limit Rashford's earnings to £15,000 per week when he signs his next United contract -- a fact that the club might need to address to avoid seeing the youngster have his head turned by the wages on offer elsewhere.
28/04/2016, 07:20 - Champions: Kane gets 45000, lfc gets 60000, solanke wants 50000
28/04/2016, 07:20 - Champions: Rashford gets 500

02/05/2016, 11:18 - Srirag: Confession of an IT Engineer.....

I work in an IT firm and it is pretty common for us to face issues with laptops. We have a service desk that solves our issues when a ticket is raised. One day I was facing some issue with Outlook and I raised a ticket to get it resolved. I got a call from Service desk lady after some time and it went this way:

Lady: Hi I'm calling from service desk, what is the problem?

Me: (I explained the problem).

Lady: Can you please share your screen and give me the control so that I can solve the issue?

Me: (I shared the screen and gave the control. She solved it!!)

Lady: You may close the ticket from your end, the issue is solved.

Me: Thank you very much, I will close the ticket.

I opened her profile in lync (it is business version of skype, where you can chat and view the profiles of your company mates etc.) and had a look at her profile. The display pic looked small in size. I instantly messaged her Employee ID to my colleague(my college mate) and asked him to have a look at her. He replied "She looks good in some angles".

I tried searching her FB profile with the help of her name, but there were too many results.

I started searching on linked in instead, I found her profile this time. I was trying to enlarge the profile pic and suddenly a message popped up - it says

" You may please stop sharing your screen!!..😂😂😂

19/05/2016, 08:24 - Champions: NICOLAI PROMISES 'BETTER ATTITUDE' IN INDIA'S 'SECOND CHANCE'
Nicolai Adam is an honest man.
“We just lost 3-1 to Tanzania. If I am honest, I have no problems admitting that we could have lost by a bigger margin,” he adds. “Our body language was bad, especially in the second half (against Tanzania) and it gave the impression that we didn’t want much,” he states during the morning recovery session as his wards jog around the ground.
“But Football God has been kind and has given us a second chance,”
It’s the ‘second chance,’ and it’s against United States of America. Not every day India gets to play them. Knowing that a good performance against them would make a real big statement not only in this Tournament but in the whole World, Nicolai informs his boys will show the “right attitude” when it kicks-off.

04/06/2016, 14:29 - Champions: The theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking angered supporters of Donald J. Trump on Monday by responding to a question about the billionaire with a baffling array of long words.

Speaking to a television interviewer in London, Hawking called Trump “a demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator,” a statement that many Trump supporters believed was intentionally designed to confuse them.

Moments after Hawking made the remark, Google reported a sharp increase in searches for the terms “demagogue,” “denominator,” and “Stephen Hawking.”

“For a so-called genius, this was an epic fail,” Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said. “If Professor Hawking wants to do some damage, maybe he should try talking in English next time.”

Later in the day, Hawking attempted to clarify his remark about the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, telling a reporter, “Trump bad man. Real bad man.”
04/06/2016, 14:29 - Champions: Epic from Hawking

Hello, newcomers! Congratulations to all of you for planning to attend the University of Florida for fall 2016!
With the help of current Indian students residing in Gainesville, IGSA at UF provides airport pickup from Gainesville Regional Airport (GNV) and temporary accommodation services to new incoming students up to not more than 2 nights after arrival in Gainesville. The main purpose of providing this facility is to provide new students a place to stay for the initial days and help make their transition easier. Do keep in mind that the availability of services will depend on the number of available volunteer hosts, especially temporary accommodation and might not be guaranteed. Temporary accommodation will be provided during the Fall semester from August 1st to August 21st 2016.
Following is the procedure to avail this facility: 
Step 1: Fill up the registration form. Last date of filing the form is July 25th, 2016, 11:59 PM (IST).

IGSA also helps incoming students in solving issues arising due to missing luggage, delay of flights etc. at the airport.

27/06/2016, 18:37 - Champions: Awaiting Chelsea ka 1st signing 😞
27/06/2016, 19:58 - Champions: Dear Messi,

I remember when I first started watching football, my dad told me about Diego Maradona and how he was the greatest to have ever stepped on a football pitch.
My children will get to know a similar version of the story, a conjurer, with a growth hormone deficiency, wearing number 10 for Argentina and how he eclipsed all the great shadows that stood in his way, even that of his own idol, Diego, who watched himself take on the world all over again in the form of the greatest player I have ever seen and am likely to see.

Lionel Messi, you are everything football stands for.

Today, you come out and say that the National Team isn’t meant for you and that it hurts to not be a champion. I understand that you’re disappointed, like the millions sitting at home rooting for you, like the thousands in your country looking up to you, like the countless who have known this game because of you.

Does it hurt enough Leo that you bid farewell to us, we who don’t dare to look at you as a mere mortal?
Does it hurt enough to throw in the towel when the world still dances to the tune of your left foot?

Maybe it does hurt like that. We saw your face after the World Cup final loss. You know, that was the moment when I really thought that Lionel Messi was the greatest of all time. You couldn’t do what Diego Maradona did. You couldn’t bring the cup home and every critic in the house still calls it, the only feather which makes you inferior to the great one.

For me, the emotion is what separates you. It always has. In an age where football is looked at as purely professional, something that is a money-maker, that moment on your walk to collect your silver medal with a look like the world had ended, that is when I felt that the purity in the game is still there, that when everything settles and the mist has cleared, people will remember you as the boy from Rosario, who could change the world with a mazy run down the right channel of a football field.

Now that you are hanging up your boots, the world knows that it wants you to stay, more than anything it has ever wanted. I can’t tell you how many souls are ready to be sold, to keep you here, mine included. These are the things wars are fought over and constellations are shaped out of.

But Leo, remember, we have loved you through thick, thin and whatever fell in the middle and we have believed in magic because you showed it to us, in front of our own eyes.

It has been 13 years since I first saw you on your merry dance. And the tears know that 13 more would also be too less a part of eternity that we want to keep seeing you do, what you do best.

Dazzle. Mesmerize. Make us believe.

And if this is the last time that we saw you in the colors of Argentina, then Leo, for everything you’ve given us,

Thank You.

07/07/2016, 17:42 - Akshay Dighe: Happy Birthday Lalit!!
07/07/2016, 23:47 - Srirag: 1. Kamasutra says : If you suck one nipple, the women herself offers the other one. And that was the origin of "buy one getone free"!
2. Did you ever notice: everything on a woman's upper body starts with a "B". Blouse, Bra, Bikini, Boobs and lower body with a "P" Peticoat, panties, pussy... That's origin of "BP"!
3. Before sex, you help each other get naked. After sex, you dress only yourself. Moral: In life no one helps you once you're fucked.
4. Success is like pregnancy. Everybody congratulates you but nobody knows how many times you got fucked to achieve it.
5. What is the difference between frustration and satisfaction? What the Fuck! and What a Fuck!
6. 3 people having sex is a threesome, 2 is a twosome. So next time someone calls you 'HANDSOME', don't take it as a compliment!
7. Life is like a dick, sometimes it becomes hard for no reason.
8. Practical thought: A husband is supposed to make his wife's panties wet, not her eyes. A wife is supposed to make her husband's dick hard, not his life..!
9. When a lady is pregnant, all her friends touch her stomach ad say "Congrats!".
But none of them come and touch the man's Penis and say "Well done!".
Moral: Hard work is never appreciated: Only result matters.
Dont delete it unless forward it to one naughty Friend

THIS IS NOT FOOTBALL: PORTUGAL'S EURO 2016 VICTORY A DAMNING INDICTMENT ON THE SPORT

Robin Bairner

Fernando Santos' side provided fitting winners of a tournament that will not live long in the memory of neutrals for positive reasons

￼COMMENT

Euro 2016 will be remembered as one of the poorest major international competitions of all time, so it is fitting that the Portugal side that claimed the trophy played in a manner that epitomised the tournament.

Dour, defensive and boring, Fernando Santos’ side ground their way to a 1-0 extra-time victory over France thanks to a fine goal from Eder that was out of keeping with what had gone before. It took them 80 minutes to muster a single shot on goal in the final, which was a bleak spectacle barely fitting of the occasion. 

The sight of the Portuguese mustered behind the ball was a common sight in the knockout phase. Their fixtures against Croatia and Poland were among the worst of a tournament not short of monotonous matches, and Sunday’s showpiece was little better. Moreover, they shambled through the group stages with three draws against modest opponents they were expected to sweep away.

It is ironic, then, that after one of the few matches they seemed to make an attempt to win – against Iceland – that Cristiano Ronaldo blasted their opponents’ defensive attitude as being a “small mentality”. 

Santos simply transposed this tactic onto superior players to win the country’s first international tournament but little love from neutrals.

￼

“I want the media to keep saying the same thing. That we're this and we're that, that we won undeservedly,” the 61-year-old – as dour in his press conferences as his side are on the field – told the media on the eve of the final.

“That's what I would like them to say that we won and we didn't deserve it. That would be amazing. I'd be going home very happy if they said that. And I will be going home very happy.”

Of course, the veteran coach justly argued that his tactics are entirely valid. Portugal did not cheat their way to success; they played fairly, diligently and were not even the beneficiaries of any dubious refereeing decisions. It was not their fault teams were incapable of breaking them down.

Portugal’s victory in Paris has drawn comparisons with Greece’s success over the Iberian nation in the final of the 2004 edition. Ronaldo was present on the field when Angelos Charisteas scored the only goal of the game to produce one of the all-time upsets.

￼

￼

Otto Rehhagel’s side were the most unloved of underdogs, playing a brand of football that made minutes feel like hours. They had no multiple Ballon d’Or winner in their ranks, no up-and-coming wonderkid in midfield and not even a two-time Champions League winner in their defence. Their success was built out of the necessity to form the most robust defensive unit the international game has seen in a generation. 

The tragedy of Portugal is that they could have been so much more exciting, yet Santos’ attitude is pragmatism taken to the nth degree. Rarely can a team comprising of so many exciting players have played with so little excitement - and that is the real shame of this side.

Ronaldo, whose final was cut sadly short by a knee injury, was able to contribute only three goals during a tournament in which his immense talents were hidden by a shroud of mind-numbing football. His brilliant backheel goal against Hungary will remain as an emblematic moment, but it was certainly not representative of his four weeks in France.

Nani, Ricardo Quaresma and even Renato Sanches, meanwhile, were unable to offer more than fleeting glimpses of their undoubtedly thrilling abilities.

Fans were warned of their dreary nature before the competition started. During the qualifying campaign, for example, they failed to win even one match by more than a single goal, including two fixtures against Armenia, who are ranked 110th in the world – below the Faroe Islands, Canada and Iraq.

This is a side that unashamedly puts substance before its style. They will, quite rightly, bask in glory at home, but history will not remember them as a great team. Santos and his players, however, will not care - they are European champions and to hell with aesthetics and the desire of fans to see a spectacle. 

“They won, you can't take the credit from them, but if you ask me if it was a football that I like to see, of course not. There'll be a lot of people who would say the same. It's efficient, I don't know if they're the best team, but they are the most effective and they won,” the great Luis Figo said of the 2004 final. 

Twelve years on, his words ring true once more.

WHERE DOES PORTUGAL'S EURO 2016 VICTORY RATE ON THE 'ANTI-FOOTBALL' SCALE?

Miles Chambers

16:05 SHARE 1

Gettyimages


The Seleccao's victory in France was hard to stomach for a fair number of football's neutrals, but were they really as negative as their detractors are making out?

Three group stage draws, a round of 16 win in extra time, victory against Poland only through penalties and a 109th-minute winner in the final. Portugal's Euro 2016 triumph was hardly comprehensive.

Football is split on the Seleccao's first major tournament victory, albeit rather one-sidedly. While some feel Fernando Santos's men should be lauded for sticking to their guns and grinding out results, no matter how uninspiring, others feel crestfallen that a brand of wholly unexciting football has been rewarded.

It matters little to Portugal, however, whose boss Fernando Santos has welcomes the harsh critics: “They say we don't deserve it but that makes me happy. I'm going home very happy.”

Like it or loathe it, Portugal are the European champions and the manner in which they achieved their goal is not an isolated incident.

To get an idea of where the Cristiano Ronaldo-led side rank in the list of all-time lacklustre triumphs, Goal looks back at some of football history's dullest success stories.

Argentina 1990￼

World Cup 1990 saw just 2.21 goals per match - the lowest in the history of the tournament - which goes some way to explaining how Argentina reached the final despite scoring less than once per game.

Four years after their Diego Maradona-inspired triumph, the Albiceleste opted for the cynical approach and went tantalisingly close to lifting the trophy again.

Argentina, led on the sidelines by Carlos Bilardo, scored just five goals in seven games. They defeated Brazil 1-0 in the second round despite being outplayed from start to finish. They then progressed via penalties in the next two matches versus Yugoslavia and hosts Italy. It took West Germany until the 85th minute to score in the final and put the anti-attackers to the sword.
 Arsenal 1992-95￼

The chant "boring, boring Arsenal" became synonymous with the Gunners in the early 1990s thanks to George Graham's insistence on grinding out results, whether or not they had goals in them.

Graham took charge of the north Londoners in 1986 but it was not until 1992 that he threw his attacking plans in the bin. In his final three seasons his team averaged 40 goals per league season compared to 66 goals in his first six campaigns.

Although Graham did not taste league success again with his new defence-centric Arsenal, he did make them the first team to do the FA and League Cup double in 1993. Graham's famous offside-playing back four of Lee Dixon, Tony Adams, Steve Bould and Nigel Winterburn is regarded as one of the best back lines that English domestic football has ever seen.
 Greece 2004￼ 
Greece's Euro 2004 victory remains arguably the most remarkable underdog story in the history of top-level football.

Otto Rehhagel realised that his team were far from the best in the tournament and he had no flair players upon whom to rely, so he carved out a formidable defensive plan which saw them play patiently (or painfully, for the attack-loving neutral) and only commit men forward for corners and set-pieces.

Greece might not have set the continent alight with their style but, as Rehhagel himself put it: "People tell me my tactics are not modern but modern football is about winning."
 La Grande Inter￼ 
Inter's side in the 1960s were the most successful to use the Catenaccio style - which means 'bolted door' in Italian.

Grabbing a goal or two on the counterattack was the name of the game, leaving opposition forwards frustrated with the cautious defenders surrounding them.

Iconic Inter coach Helenio Herrera guided hisNerazzurri ranks to two European Cups and three Serie A titles with the system - world-class defenders such as Giacinto Facchetti, Tarcisio Burgnich and Armando Picchi ensuring misery for all opposition attackers.
 Rangers 2008￼

Turning Catenaccio into the mockingly namedWaltenaccio, Walter Smith had his fair share of critics during Rangers' 2007-08 European endeavours.

Lionel Messi, yet to hit his unplayable prime, grumbled that "Rangers didn't want to play football, they practised anti-football from the first minute" after Barcelona were held to a goalless draw in the Champions League by the Scots.

Away from the big guns after demotion into the Uefa Cup, Smith ploughed on with his ultra-defensive approach and it almost paid off: they clawed their way to the final by scoring five goals in eight games - only to be beaten 2-0 by Zenit St Petersburg.
 Stoke 2008-13￼

It took Stoke City 116 Premier League games to record possession statistics of over 50 per cent in a Premier League match following promotion in 2008 - a baffling statistic considering that they had never really been threatened by relegation.

Tony Pulis imbued a brand of direct football that took no interest in flowing, fluid or even fun football and the Britannia Stadium was frequently a fortress because of it.

Only once in Pulis's five full seasons in charge of the Potters did they score more goals in the league than games played and eventually the fanbase and club craved more creativity, which led to his departure.

Matuidi: France leave final with huge regret

MATUIDI: FRANCE LEAVE FINAL WITH HUGE REGRET

Les Bleus suffered a devastating defeat to Portugal in the Euro 2016 decider in Paris and the midfielder wants to eradicate the match from his memory

Blaise Matuidi conceded that France have been left with a feeling of huge regret after going down to Portugal in the Euro 2016 final.

The Paris Saint-Germain midfielder played the full 120 minutes as Les Bleus suffered defeat at Stade de France courtesy of a dramatic extra-time goal from substitute Eder.

Matuidi, 29, could not hide his disappointment after the match and felt France would have to wipe the result from the minds quickly.

"A lot of regrets, a lot of regret obviously," he told reporters. "When you lose in a final you can only have regrets. 

"It is too soon to speak about how to recover yet. The main feeling is the disappointment. We need to forget about it first and then we will see what happens. 

"Obviously we will need to act fast because there are the [World Cup] qualification matches in September. We will need to be ready then.

"It is very difficult because we have done the job in order to play the final and win it. It is always very tough to lose in a final. It is also what football is about. We will have to bounce back, go on holiday and then prepare for 2018."

Matuidi felt that while France were lacking in energy on Sunday, they still had enough possession and chances to beat Portugal and win the tournament.

Indeed, Les Bleus had 18 shots to the 10 from Fernando Santos' side, but they could not find a way past goalkeeper Rui Patricio and the Selecao's resolute back-line.

"It was very close - we got chances even if we were not very fresh, not physically at our very top," said Matuidi.

"Despite that, we had chances to score. We got the possession. They also got chances but I think less than us. Then we were also tired in a way and that is to be taken in account close to the end of the game.  

"The Portuguese team has the merit to trust until the end that they can do it and they have been rewarded for that."

The crushing defeat, though, has not left Matuidi without a sense of perspective over the positive effect France's performances over the last month have had on the host nation.

He continued: "We can have regret but also be proud of what we achieved in the tournament. It was good, even very good. 

"We were able to unite the French population and there was a lot of passion from them. We gave some happiness to people who love football and maybe some who were not a big fan of football previously are now starting to like it."

NO MORE FATALISM, LOSS OR LAMENT: RONALDO LEADS PORTUGAL INTO NEW ERA

The Real Madrid forward was withdrawn early on in Sunday's final because of a knee injury, but his role in their victory was vital as the nation celebrate a first-ever title

￼COMMENT

Portugal rewrote their history as a footballing nation on Sunday night. A Selecao had not beaten France since 1975 and had never claimed an international trophy, so many Portuguese people expected a similar story this time. But instead, they saw a different ending.

By losing the Euro 2004 final at home to Greece, Portugal looked to have blown their best opportunity of success in a major tournament. Even with 2002 World Cup winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari in charge, the team was unable to win the trophy in Lisbon and the tragedy of that loss was, in many ways, so typically Portuguese.

Once one of the world's most powerful countries due to its great explorers and discoveries at sea, Portugal built an empire but fell into decadence as a nation and is struggling economically nowadays ts culture is very much marked by elements of fatalism and lament, nostalgia and loss.

RONALDO: PORTUGAL DESERVED TO WIN EURO 2016RONALDO: I NEVER DOUBTED TEAM-MATES OR SANTOSEURO 2016 FINAL - RE-LIVE THE ACTION!

Its traditional music, fado (which means fate), sums up this trend. All about loves lost and reminiscing over an era of a great Portugal, it looks back with tristesse to better times. The songs are bathed in ruefulness and regret. And in bars and taverns across the country, many Portuguese watch the shows and cry.

And prior to the Euro 2016 final, something similar had happened with their football team. Despite the talent of a "golden generation" including Luis Figo, Rui Costa, Deco, Ricardo Carvalho and a young Cristiano Ronaldo in 2004, it all ended in tears once again at the Estadio Da Luz.

But eight years on, that has changed. On the day of the match against France, Portuguese paper A Bola led with a front cover which announced: "We will win". On the back page, meanwhile, there was a cartoon in which a man told a barber how the team had been playing poorly during Euro 2016. "Be quiet," he replied. "The Portugal of fado has been asleep until now. We don't want to wake them up."

￼

On Monday, the Portuguese people will wake to positive news. This time, their was no tragic outcome, no fatalistic finale. This time, pessimism was replaced by optimism and Portugal prevailed - even surviving the loss of their finest footballer early on. This time, they are champions of Europe.

It is a significant shift in fortunes and Ronaldo has been at the forefront. Although the Real Madrid forward limped off the Stade de France pitch following a blow to the knee that left him in tears and unable to continue despite twice trying to play on, his part in the advancement of this team is important.

Brought up in humble surroundings on the island of Madeira, Cristiano travelled to the mainland as an 11-year-old with a sign around his neck to meet scouts from Sporting in Lisbon. And 20 years on from that, his ambition, commitment and dedication have seen him win three Ballons d'Or, three Champions League crowns and much more. As much as anyone else, he has shown his compatriots that it can be done - and his team-mates even did it without him.

￼

￼

Ronaldo was still there on the sidelines, barking instructions to his team-mates, demanding more noise from the Portuguese supporters and kicking every ball in the unorthodox role of assistant coach alongside coach Fernando Santos. And right-back Cedric Soares revealed afterwards he had given a rousing speech to the players during the interval.

"At half-time, Cristiano had fantastic words for us," he said. "He gave us a lot of confidence and said 'listen people, I'm sure we will win, so stay together and fight for it.' "It was really unbelievable. I think all the team had a fantastic attitude. And we showed tonight when you fight as one you are much much stronger.

"He was fantastic. His attitude was unbelievable. He always had a lot of motivational words and all the team of course reacted to them, so it was very good. He had fantastic words for each player in each moment of the game."

One of those players was goalscorer Eder, whose superb strike to win the match in extra time surprised many who had written him off as one of the poorest forwards at Euro 2016. Afterwards, the player himself said: "Ronaldo told me I would score the winning goal for the team. He gave me this strength, this energy, and it was vital."

For Ronaldo, only winning is enough. At his museum in Madeira the 31-year-old proudly displays his Ballons d'Or, yet there is no sign of the silver balls he has won for finishing second in the annual individual award. Those mean very little to him.

￼

But this will mean everything. "I'm so happy – very happy," he said afterwards. "This was something I've wanted for a long time now, ever since 2004. I asked God to give me another chance.

"This is one of the happiest moments in my career. The Portuguese people deserve this; our players deserved this."

11/07/2016, 16:23 - Champions: I'll help
11/07/2016, 16:24 - Champions: Euro 2016 will be remembered as one of the poorest major international competitions of all time, so it is fitting that the Portugal side that claimed the trophy played in a manner that epitomised the tournament.
Dour, defensive and boring, Fernando Santos’ side ground their way to a 1-0 extra-time victory over France thanks to a fine goal from Eder that was out of keeping with what had gone before. It took them 80 minutes to muster a single shot on goal in the final, which was a bleak spectacle barely fitting of the occasion.

21/07/2016, 07:15 - Akash Gore: The Canteen Stores Department, (CSD), is a solely owned Government of India Enterprise under Indian Ministry of Defence. Its head office is located at Adelphi 119 MK Road Mumbai-400020 and has its depot sub-depots in all major military bases operated by theIndian Armed Forces.

CSD sells a wide variety of products like household provisions, kitchen appliances, alcoholic drinks, cars, and sports equipment. Though originally meant exclusively for active and retired members of the Armed Forces personnel (defined as troops), it is slowly and steadily being expanded to include GREF, NCC Units at Group HQ level, TA units, CDA's staff,Indian Ordnance Factories, Embarkation HQs, civilians paid from defence estimates, civilians paid out of civil estimates, and Paramilitary forces under operational/administrative control of the Army civilian government employees. Generally, these goods are procured by CSD in bulk, and sold at concessional rates (without taxes), compared with retail prices. CSD prices are low as the goods sold are exempt from taxes. A huge profit is earned by the Canteen Stores Department.[2]

⚡Riyad Mahrez's agent has denied❌ Arsenal's interest in the Leicester City🐺 player. Various reports📰 are suggesting that the winger is keen on leaving the club but Claudio Ranieri👔 is adamant that the Algerian will stay. A move for Mahrez makes sense💡 for Arsene Wenger🎓 who needs someone reliable on the flanks. Alexis Sanches⭐ is currently nursing an ankle injury and could miss the entire pre-season tour.

Hope you enjoy it.

"In my next life I want to live my life backwards. You start out dead and get that out of the way. Then you wake up in an old people's home feeling better every day. You get kicked out for being too healthy, go collect your pension, and then when you start work, you get a gold watch and a party on your first day. You work for 40 years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You party, drink alcohol, and are generally promiscuous, then you are ready for high school. You then go to primary school, you become a kid, you play. You have no responsibilities, you become a baby until you are born. And then you spend your last 9 months floating in luxurious spa-like conditions with central heating and room service on tap, larger quarters every day and then Voila! You finish off as an orgasm!"

Bloody brilliant 👏👏👏

30/09/2016, 11:36 - Champions: Jose Mourinho has explained THAT touchline outburst which occurred just prior to Manchester United 's Europa League game against Zorya Luhansk - as seen in the video above.

The Red Devils boss was visibly angry over assistant manager Rui Faria's attempted explanation of the tactics to Paul Pogba .

He was then further outraged when Faria and two of United's coaches attempted to discuss the tactics book again in the dugout.

Mourinho charged over to the three men, held up fingers and slammed the book in frustration.

Following the game, Mourinho explained what all the drama was about.

He said: "You know set pieces, organisation... they changed their team before the game and Paul was a bit confused with the changes.

"And obviously I want my assistants to care of all the details."

02/10/2016, 20:21 - Champions: You don't have strong defense in epl only good midfield,  which makes an average defense looks good
02/10/2016, 20:22 - Lalit Patil: These players also facilitate attack
02/10/2016, 20:22 - Lalit Patil: And give confidence to mids
02/10/2016, 20:22 - Lalit Patil: I'm not saying sab clean sheet milega
02/10/2016, 20:23 - Champions: Jis league mein goals pace pe hote hai over skills... Defense are helpless in most situation

02/10/2016, 20:24 - Champions: Defense are toothless in their own box
02/10/2016, 20:25 - Lalit Patil: City couldn't drive ball much in other half in first half of game

02/10/2016, 20:25 - Lalit Patil: This is where these players come in
02/10/2016, 20:25 - Lalit Patil: They facilitate that
02/10/2016, 20:26 - Lalit Patil: I'm not saying 2 goal nahi khate
02/10/2016, 20:26 - Champions: Luiz isn't a great CB,  but checkout his passes to Costa from own half
02/10/2016, 20:26 - Lalit Patil: Lol Luiz kaha se aya

02/10/2016, 20:32 - Lalit Patil: To handle his ass

08/10/2016, 17:51 - Shivprasad Nair: *WHY MEN ARE SO HONEST*
 
If you are female & reading this article then just realize the value of a man; and if male, then feel proud after reading it! 

One day, while a woodcutter was cutting a branch of a tree above a river, his axe fell into the river.

When he cried out, the Angel appeared & asked, *"Why are you crying?"*

The woodcutter replied that his axe has fallen into water & he needed it to make a living.

The Angel went down into the water & reappeared with a *Golden Axe*. "Is this your axe?" the Angel asked. The woodcutter replied: *"No."*

The Angel again went down & came up with a *Silver Axe.* "Is this your axe?" the Angel asked. Again, the woodcutter replied: *"No."*

The Angel went down again & came up with an *Iron Axe*. "Is this your axe?" the Angel asked. The woodcutter replied: *"Yes."* 

The Angel was pleased with the man's honesty & gave him all 3 Axes to keep, & the woodcutter went home happy. 

Some time later the woodcutter was walking with his wife along the riverbank, & his wife fell into the river.

When he cried out, the Angel again appeared & asked him: "Why are you crying?"

*"Oh, my wife has fallen into the water!"*

The Angel went down into the water & came up with *DEEPIKA PADUKONE*.

"Is this your wife?" the Angel asked. *"Yes,"* cried the woodcutter.

The Angel was furious. *"You lied!* That is an untruth!" The woodcutter replied, "Oh, forgive me, It is a misunderstanding. You see, if I had said *'NO'* to DEEPIKA PADUKONE, you would have come up with *KAREENA KAPOOR*. Then if I said *'NO'* to her, you would have come up with *MY WIFE*. Had I then said *'YES,' you would have given me all 3.*
I'm a poor man, & not able to take care of 3 wives, so *THAT'S why I said YES to DEEPIKA."*

The moral of this story is: Whenever a man lies, it is for a *good & honorable reason & for the benefit of others.* 

That's our story, &
we're sticking to it!

*WE MEN ARE TRULY HONORABLE!*

18/10/2016, 13:56 - Champions: Jose ka problem in his bad days at chelsea was.... He was too great to accept that his management skills had any problem
18/10/2016, 13:56 - Champions: Though he was right in thinking that
18/10/2016, 13:56 - Champions: But u can't put the whole blame on playerd
18/10/2016, 13:56 - Champions: You have to shield them....
18/10/2016, 13:57 - Champions: He should have resorted to his old ways like in Porto... Where he had nothing to loose
18/10/2016, 13:57 - Champions: But now he had everything to loose.... And zero will to experiment
18/10/2016, 13:58 - Champions: Ab zlatan ek bhi goal nahi maara toh bhi he'll play next 15 matches
18/10/2016, 13:58 - Champions: That's how adamant he's become
18/10/2016, 20:06 - Lalit Patil: Guys just so that you know, its difficult to score a goal even on 1v1, so tis not like if you are great striker and you get one goal chance your team has one goal.
18/10/2016, 20:08 - Lalit Patil: Goal scoring needs the player to have a map of keeper and every other defender and predict where they gonna move in next few moments and put it on the spot. Its not easy as it looks on TV or fifa. Plus being a striker you don't really get ball touches and suddenly its one ball for 5 seconds. For defenders even if you shoot the ball in air without any thought where it's gonna end up is a valid effort.
18/10/2016, 23:03 - Champions: Yo...
18/10/2016, 23:31 - Srirag: <Media omitted>

23/10/2016, 12:04 - Champions: Abhay Deol on Pak artist ban

"Why are you doing a half-hearted job? Ban the business dealings, the import, the export because when you do half a job no one will take you seriously.
I don't take the government seriously because they are only banning us from collaborating with artistes. They are not banning businessmen from making business," he commented.
The 'DevD' actor elaborated, adding, "So, if you really mean what you say, then go the distance. Then I will take you seriously. Right now it is not looking like you mean it, it just looks like it gets you a lot of publicity and makes a lot of noise. But really what is the point of it? I will support it if you think banning anything to do with Pakistan is going to help our jawans, fine. But I don't see the whole distance. I see one little thing looked at and banned and another part being left. Sounds hypocritical to me."
The actor had no qualms calling things as they were.

24/10/2016, 08:32 - Champions: He lined up way defensively.... He said na goal inside 30 second broke all his strategies
24/10/2016, 08:32 - Champions: He came for a draw and a goal on counter maybe
24/10/2016, 08:33 - Champions: Had it not been a goal in 1st minute.... We would have witnessed a boring draw too
24/10/2016, 09:04 - Nimish Kulkarni: Is schweinsteiger still at utd?

24/10/2016, 09:40 - Champions: Jose jitne jaldi sack hoga utna acha hai utd k liye

24/10/2016, 13:18 - Akash Gore: Today it was right to call our fans in a moment when I was listening to only the supporters of Manchester United at 4-0.

"The players, after a 4-0 win, deserved a great clap. It's very normal
24/10/2016, 13:19 - Akash Gore: Manutd supporters were the loudest trailing 4-0
24/10/2016, 13:19 - Akash Gore: at an away game !!
24/10/2016, 13:29 - Champions: Consolation for u
24/10/2016, 13:29 - Champions: Probably didn't want to humiliate mourinho more
24/10/2016, 13:32 - Champions: A certain section started a chant against mourinho that u are not special one... But others made them stop it...

25/10/2016, 09:43 - Nimish Kulkarni: All of this negativity around any manager is so wrong....every manager deserves a fair amount of time to build his team
25/10/2016, 09:44 - Nimish Kulkarni: Fans are often too quick to judge...these guys have been in football longer than we have even seen it
25/10/2016, 09:46 - Nimish Kulkarni: But Mourinho is an asshole 😝
25/10/2016, 09:47 - Champions: 😂😂
25/10/2016, 09:48 - Sagar Kesarwani: 😂
25/10/2016, 09:49 - Nimish Kulkarni: Vo video dekha hai kya "dhika chika dhinka chila Mourinho Bhosadika"?

25/10/2016, 09:50 - Nimish Kulkarni: Yup
25/10/2016, 09:50 - Champions: Yea
25/10/2016, 09:50 - Champions: United fans bhi hai shayad us video mein
25/10/2016, 09:51 - Champions: @Srirag @Akash Gore @Sagar Kesarwani what's your status on mourinho
25/10/2016, 09:52 - Akash Gore: Mou is a cunt..
25/10/2016, 09:52 - Akash Gore: But he is a great manager
25/10/2016, 09:52 - Akash Gore: Who needs time
25/10/2016, 09:52 - Akash Gore: So did Moyes..not Van Gaal though
25/10/2016, 09:55 - Nimish Kulkarni: Van Gaal was a joke
25/10/2016, 10:03 - Srirag: Well what he can do good and bad everyone knows. During this seasons match's so far there were more than couple of games where United played fantastic football, something which was missing last season. Most of the games where United played better had a good team selection. He is kinda screwing the first team selection in big match. Though it's high time now that he gets the team together and not just play with bunch of individual players.
25/10/2016, 10:10 - Srirag: He needs to find a perfect partner for Pogba and a position. Every match you have someone new playing alongside him.
25/10/2016, 11:27 - Champions: So everyone's highly in favour of mourinho right now
25/10/2016, 11:28 - Akash Gore: Not me !
25/10/2016, 11:28 - Champions: So sack asap for u?
25/10/2016, 11:28 - Akash Gore: No no..no sacking
25/10/2016, 11:28 - Akash Gore: I meant I don't like him as a manager
25/10/2016, 11:28 - Akash Gore: Though he will get things done for Manutd
25/10/2016, 11:29 - Akash Gore: Which is probably what Manutd need right now..the Aura
25/10/2016, 11:29 - Champions: I doubt that... Utd needs the aura more than anything right now
25/10/2016, 11:29 - Champions: When u play with flair... Oppositions fears u
25/10/2016, 11:29 - Akash Gore: This setting up the team for a draw makes the team lose confidence in themselves
25/10/2016, 11:30 - Champions: Exactly
25/10/2016, 11:30 - Akash Gore: U got IBRA
25/10/2016, 11:30 - Champions: Flair brings rhythm brings confidence
25/10/2016, 11:30 - Akash Gore: let's bang everyone
25/10/2016, 11:30 - Akash Gore: Should be the moto
25/10/2016, 11:30 - Akash Gore: We are Manchester United
25/10/2016, 11:30 - Champions: Ibra has been made a mockery.... Because of the tactics
25/10/2016, 11:31 - Akash Gore: Ibra ko pucha goal miss kiya to bolta hai chances banao goals will come
25/10/2016, 11:31 - Akash Gore: It's obvious he doesn't prefer this
25/10/2016, 11:31 - Champions: When u are sitting back trying to not make mistakes and be in the good books of mourinho.... Won't help in long term
25/10/2016, 11:31 - Akash Gore: He's a bully..u can't expect him to play a game to be bullied
25/10/2016, 11:32 - Champions: True
25/10/2016, 11:34 - Akash Gore: Now that the tough games are done
25/10/2016, 11:35 - Akash Gore: Get the confidence back
25/10/2016, 11:35 - Akash Gore: Let's attack
25/10/2016, 11:35 - Akash Gore: Rashford bechara defence karta hai
25/10/2016, 11:35 - Champions: As an outsider my view is simple... Mourinho brings instant noodle success,  which utd don't really need atm
They need someone to build a squad who can play with dominance,  confidence,  old school football..
 Not use fellaini to destroy football every weekend
25/10/2016, 11:36 - Akash Gore: Shaw set hoega to mazza aaega
25/10/2016, 11:36 - Akash Gore: Look at kloop

25/10/2016, 11:36 - Akash Gore: And he is still in the psychological setback
25/10/2016, 11:36 - Akash Gore: Doesn't go in for tackles
25/10/2016, 11:37 - Champions: Sad... Was a great player
25/10/2016, 11:37 - Akash Gore: He is..5-6 game lagega usko
25/10/2016, 11:37 - Akash Gore: Hasnt lost pace
25/10/2016, 11:37 - Akash Gore: Hasnt lost anything from the injury
25/10/2016, 11:37 - Akash Gore: Just is apprehensive..which is obv
25/10/2016, 11:38 - Champions: Hmm.. Post injury trauma

25/10/2016, 11:39 - Akash Gore: when he had a good game..not good for a player to be publicly shamed
25/10/2016, 11:39 - Akash Gore: After such an injury
25/10/2016, 11:39 - Akash Gore: Haar gaya na..Kuch bhi bol doesn't matter..so why get the morale down
25/10/2016, 11:39 - Akash Gore: When u not gonna get anything out of ir
25/10/2016, 11:39 - Akash Gore: My fault bolke nikal na chupchap bc

25/10/2016, 11:41 - Akash Gore: Pehle to wo players ke saath gang up karta tha..we are together..we play dirty..fuck it..we don't give a shit..we are togethrt
25/10/2016, 11:41 - Akash Gore: Ab saala players ki bhi maarta hai
25/10/2016, 11:44 - Champions: That's what upset roman
25/10/2016, 11:46 - Champions: He did a survey asking players... And no one was getting along with him... 
Someone also said... He isn't looking into our eyes while talking
25/10/2016, 11:46 - Champions: Isliye itna abrupt aack hua
25/10/2016, 11:47 - Champions: Warna he survived the worst phase.... He could have completed the season atleast
25/10/2016, 11:47 - Champions: Jose lost the chelsea dressing room
25/10/2016, 11:47 - Champions: But so glad we have Conte now....
25/10/2016, 11:48 - Champions: Just check his post match conference.... You can see what a humble hardworking guy Conte is
25/10/2016, 11:48 - Champions: At this age he is way wiser than mourinho
25/10/2016, 11:49 - Champions: Footballing brain of mou maybe better,  but as a Man with principles Conte is far ahead
25/10/2016, 11:50 - Akash Gore: ManUtd will be back !

25/10/2016, 11:54 - Nimish Kulkarni: Tabhi mou defend nai karega
25/10/2016, 12:34 - Champions: Mou bolta hai 3rd and 4th goal.... Counter pe khaaya.... Proper constructed goals the wo....

25/10/2016, 14:09 - Champions: Mou fans ko bohot delude karne ki koshish karta hai.....
25/10/2016, 14:09 - Champions: Chelsea mein tha tab penalty penalty kiya
25/10/2016, 14:10 - Champions: Some of them were right.... But you have to look beyond things not in your control
25/10/2016, 15:38 - Champions: Times: Mourinho leaves assistant Rui Faria to take charge of training and keeps his distance with the players. #mufc

“Yeah. And Trump is now President of the US”. I continued “And Britain is not part of European Union. There was a Brexit”.

Sleeping Beauty was on the verge of fainting again.

“I hope Sir Alex is still managing Manchester United?” she said.

“Nope. Its Mourinho now. And while you were asleep, United was managed by Moyes and Van Gaal. Giggs too”.

“Wow. Too much has changed. Is there any tranquility? Is there anything which has not changed?” she asked.

“Arsenal is still fourth!”

27/11/2016, 10:04 - Champions: He played much better after conceding
27/11/2016, 10:05 - Champions: As far as wing back is concerned... Alonso never promised shot taking abilities 
It's foolish to expect that from him
27/11/2016, 10:05 - Champions: And has a weaker right foot too
27/11/2016, 10:07 - Champions: But he's doing the basics right... Running, defense and good quality crosses
27/11/2016, 10:13 - Shivprasad Nair: Still he is getting most of shooting chances
27/11/2016, 10:14 - Shivprasad Nair: Should capitalize

28/11/2016, 06:41 - Nimish Kulkarni: lol
28/11/2016, 06:48 - Champions: If Mou at United, was a guy on a Tinder date, he'd be the one picking up the chick in a Lamborghini. Taking her to a 5 star restaurant and paying too much for the noodles because the oyster sauce came in a pearl studded bottle.

Then on the way back to drop her, he'd show her his "toys", but leave his condoms on the bench of his mansion's lawn. 

Hence would manage to drop her, but not her pants. So he goes back to the restaurant and screams at the waiter for not taking the order in French.
28/11/2016, 06:50 - Champions: Mourinho ka sent off compilation bhi ban sakta hai ab..... 😂😂

01/12/2016, 16:30 - Champions: LUKE SHAW: ‘THIS CHELSEA PLAYER IS THE TOUGHEST I’VE COME UP AGAINST’

Looking back on his career so far, Shaw has opted for a slightly questionable selection when evaluating his toughest match-up, and his choice?

Victor Moses!

Shaw told the Daily Star: “I’ve said this before, and a lot of people rinse me for it, but (Victor) Moses, was, I would say, my toughest opponent.

“Just the power and strength he had, so direct and never game me a second to breath.

“Obviously I was pretty young, I think it was maybe my first or second season with Southampton but when I think back he was the toughest game I’ve had.”

06/12/2016, 15:21 - Champions: His life is ruled by football, to the point where he spends sleepless hours rewinding details in his mind, searching for solutions. He wakes in the night with a bright idea, turns on the lights and makes notes, much to the annoyance of his wife Elisabetta.
06/12/2016, 17:24 - Lalit Patil: Fuck man, such a genius.
06/12/2016, 17:46 - Srirag: It somehow shows in his reactions during the match.

06/12/2016, 17:53 - Sagar Kesarwani: But he doesn't get carried away
06/12/2016, 18:29 - Champions: There's so much to learn from Antonio Conte the man....
06/12/2016, 18:36 - Champions: Now it seems so stupid to even think that this guy could fix matches....
06/12/2016, 18:39 - Lalit Patil: Just cause we read an article online
06/12/2016, 18:39 - Lalit Patil: Which claims he wakes up in night and thinks of football.
06/12/2016, 18:39 - Champions: Nope bcoz i have observed him for last 5 months
06/12/2016, 18:40 - Lalit Patil: What you observe on TV is segregated and manufactured
06/12/2016, 18:40 - Champions: And by this i don't mean waking up at night and making notes 😅
06/12/2016, 18:40 - Lalit Patil: Even selected so that you have a bias
06/12/2016, 18:40 - Champions: There is something called as body language which u can't fake
06/12/2016, 18:41 - Lalit Patil: Maybe you have to when you are a star and get on TV for everything

06/12/2016, 18:42 - Lalit Patil: But whatever
06/12/2016, 18:43 - Champions: U can't fake 24*7 when u are not benefitting

06/12/2016, 18:43 - Lalit Patil: The man ain't fake, news might be
06/12/2016, 18:44 - Lalit Patil: Oh no I prefer watching football, not sides that follow
06/12/2016, 18:44 - Champions: As u wish
07/12/2016, 13:51 - Shivprasad Nair: But the Belgium international is still seething that Luiz managed to escape punishment. 

"When I see David Luiz, if i do that it's a red card - eight games," he told Sky Sports.

"It's alway: 'Fellaini's bad, he does this, he does that.' They don't see the others."

09/12/2016, 09:14 - Sagar Kesarwani: But many exceptions also
09/12/2016, 09:14 - Champions: West ham had an offer to sign him at end of contract after loan.. They didn't
09/12/2016, 09:14 - Champions: We have Conte at helm now... Spot the difference
09/12/2016, 09:14 - Akash Gore: Victor Moses is like James milner

09/12/2016, 09:15 - Akash Gore: Valencia is rightly a right back if at all he plays..he is not a manutd winger atleast
09/12/2016, 09:16 - Akash Gore: The difference being we almost ended up victorious..n Chelsea doesn't and wont😂
09/12/2016, 09:16 - Nimish Kulkarni: ya..it's been only 13 games they haven't won anything yet
09/12/2016, 09:16 - Akash Gore: The only rival club fans I respect are arsenal fans

09/12/2016, 09:17 - Akash Gore: Loyal in victory and defeat..just like Manutd fans..the true ones I mean !!
09/12/2016, 09:17 - Nimish Kulkarni: its like calling nani as future Ronaldo on his debut game
09/12/2016, 09:17 - Akash Gore: Not on his debut..on his try outs

09/12/2016, 09:18 - Akash Gore: If there is one club who I'd back for a PL title other than manutd..it has to be Arsenal without a doubt!!!
09/12/2016, 09:19 - Akash Gore: Last year too..I wanted arsenal to win than Leicester
09/12/2016, 09:19 - Nimish Kulkarni: then people with big money like Abrohimovc and oil kings came and screwed it up
09/12/2016, 09:20 - Akash Gore: N now manutd is screwing it too
09/12/2016, 09:20 - Akash Gore: 😭
09/12/2016, 09:21 - Nimish Kulkarni: I hope Utd start playing well again and Arsenal start winning so that we have the original giants and the spirit of the game back

28/12/2016, 19:03 - Champions: Manchester United will not make a move for Benfica defender Victor Lindelof during the January transfer window.

United manager Jose Mourinho was reported to be interested in the 22-year-old Sweden centre-back.

However, BBC Sport understands the form of Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo in central defence has persuaded manager Jose Mourinho he does not need to buy.

The Portuguese also has cover at centre-back in Eric Bailly, Chris Smalling and Daley Blind.

Reports from Portugal had claimed Lindelof would become the club's most expensive all-time defender, costing between £38m and £42m, and that he had been assigned a squad number at Old Trafford,

Since Jones and Rojo were paired together for the first time in the 3-1 win against Swansea on 6 November, United are unbeaten for 11 games, one short of equalling their best run since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.

Jones and Rojo have been in central defence together for nine of those matches, when they have conceded seven goals.

01/01/2017, 12:37 - Champions: Not their fault when they have finished 4th everytime
01/01/2017, 12:38 - Champions: But why Liverpool more than city or chelsea
01/01/2017, 12:39 - Champions: Imagine the apathy which will fall on your manchester fans living in Manchester

01/01/2017, 20:29 - Shivprasad Nair: I hav alli
01/01/2017, 20:42 - Akash Gore: Herrera is a captain

Michael Carrick was ruled out with illness and it was Ander Herrera who was chosen to fill his roll in front of the back four.

He was lucky to get a game in two years under Van Gaal. But when Smalling was taken off in the second half, Mourinho told the Spaniard to take the captain’s armband.

There were other senior players on the pitch like David De Gea and Ibrahimovic. It just shows how highly Mourinho regards Herrera
01/01/2017, 20:49 - Champions: Sahi player hai herrera
01/01/2017, 20:49 - Champions: Happy that mou brought him back
01/01/2017, 20:49 - Akash Gore: Mou actually changed his position

01/01/2017, 21:39 - Champions: Sanchez not as forward?
01/01/2017, 21:39 - Sagar Kesarwani: Today Giroud and Perez both are playing
01/01/2017, 21:47 - Sagar Kesarwani: What a brilliant goal
01/01/2017, 21:47 - Akash Gore: Who?

03/01/2017, 21:18 - Shivprasad Nair: US Economy....Brilliant comment!
  
 
Dr. Marc Faber, the investment guru, concluded his monthly bulletin  with the following comments! :
 
"The federal government is sending each of us a $600 rebate.
If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, the money goes to China .
If we spend it on gasoline it goes to the Arabs.
If we buy a computer, it will go to India .
If we purchase fruits and vegetables it will go to Mexico , Honduras and Guatemala .
If we purchase a good car, it will go to Germany  and Japan .
If we purchase useless crap, it will go to Taiwan .
In short, none of it will help the American economy.
The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on Guns, Prostitutes, and Beer, since these are the only products still produced in the US .

11/01/2017, 10:44 - Akash Gore: Pogba has been brilliant with his distribution
11/01/2017, 10:44 - Akash Gore: !!
11/01/2017, 10:46 - Srirag: No it doesn't work that way, United will be in profit. Let's take 20mil as the cost united paid for Schneiderlin which is for a contract of 5 years. So the expense shown is 4mil per year plus his wages, let's take 6 mil. So total United's cost for Schneiderlin is 10 mil per Year. Now the sold him after 2 years so they only spent 20mil on him and earned 30mil.
11/01/2017, 10:46 - Srirag: So it's not a loss
11/01/2017, 10:48 - Srirag: This is how the total expense and profit is calculated.
11/01/2017, 10:48 - Akash Gore: 👍🏻

11/01/2017, 10:50 - Akash Gore: Mast
11/01/2017, 10:50 - Srirag: Plus the pace of Mkhitaryan and Rashford
11/01/2017, 10:51 - Akash Gore: Rooney bhi bhaag raha hai aaj kal
11/01/2017, 10:51 - Srirag: Is giving a pain to opponent
11/01/2017, 10:51 - Akash Gore: Due to the pace at which the team plays!

11/01/2017, 14:17 - Srirag: Considering the current form of both teams it's going to be a great game.
11/01/2017, 14:17 - Srirag: But Liverpool defence is more fragile
11/01/2017, 14:17 - Srirag: So I give united edge over Liverpool also considering United's form.
11/01/2017, 14:19 - Srirag: Also did u understand @918097221640 why united is in profit by selling Schneiderlin

He concluded: “Here everything is new but at the level of players I found some great talents. But talent needs to be worked on so it can be inserted on a team. It’s well known I don’t handle losses well, I try to avoid them at all cost. With work, almost maniacal. I want the players to have more information so they avoid losing. When we lose I should take it more serenely, even my family tells me so. But I can’t sleep, I try to understand why. I would like to be more superficial sometimes. But the day I’ll be more superficial I will have lost everything that I am”.

21/01/2017, 18:50 - Champions: Can swansea draw?
21/01/2017, 18:55 - Champions: Groans of frustration ring around Anfield as the two teams make their way off the pitch, and they certainly aren't coming from the Swansea fans. The away side have defended admirably thus far, resulting in them continually frustrating a Liverpool side that have struggled to test Lukasz Fabianski. At the other end, they went closest to opening the scoring, with a rare chance on goal seeing Carroll hit the post. They'll have to be a little more adventurous if they want to leave with all three points, but, so far, everything is going to plan for Paul Clement's new side.

Means Barca will be given 3 to 0 victory.
Total will be the PSG 4 barca 3
Then,will PSG succeed to qualify the next step?

04/03/2017, 00:54 - Champions: A highly successful Manager was going home in his car when he saw two men along the roadside eating grass. Disturbed by the sight, he ordered his driver to stop and got out to investigate.

He asked one man
"Why are you eating grass?"

"We don't have any money for food," the poor man replied. "We have to eat grass."

"Well, then, you can come with me to my house and I'll feed you" the manager said.

"But sir, I have a wife and five children with me. They are over there, under that tree".

"Bring them along," the manager replied. Turning to the other poor man he stated, "You come with us also."

The second man, in a pitiful voice then said, "But sir, I also have a wife and seven children with me!"

"Bring them all, as well," the manager answered.

They all entered the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as it was.

One of the poor fellows turned to the Manager and said, "Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you."

The manager replied, "Glad to do it. You'll really love my place; the grass is almost 1 meter high!"

_*Lesson :* Never trust Managers ... They will go to any extreme to finish their job._

*And there is none like a KIND MANAGER* 😜

08/03/2017, 09:14 - Champions: Ha
08/03/2017, 10:22 - Srirag: I saw the highlights just now, must say arsenal played really well. It was a clear penalty which they deserved and with the couple of chances that Giroud missed, they should have had atleast 3 in first half. Also the red card wasn't fair at all, he hardly did anything to get that red. Totally biased decision. But all said arsenal should have maintained a bit composure and professionalism, the last two goals were as if Bayern is playing against some school kids.
08/03/2017, 11:42 - Champions: Arsenal fan tv is gonna be fun 😂
08/03/2017, 11:42 - Akash Gore: This match could easily have been Arsenal winning 3-0

09/03/2017, 11:48 - Akash Gore: Well..You are taking sides under the garb of not taking sides
09/03/2017, 11:48 - Akash Gore: Atleast we take sides up front n not in a sly mocking manner 😜
09/03/2017, 11:49 - Akash Gore: N I don't think Ronaldo has dived to even half of what Neymar n Suarez have already in their careers
09/03/2017, 11:51 - Akash Gore: N now Khodke will say I didn't mention Ronaldo..How would u know..well I know you Khodke 😜
09/03/2017, 11:52 - Akash Gore: Athletics legend Usain Bolt has revealed a failure in Cristiano Ronaldo's running style, despite the icon being one of the fastest players in the game.   

James Whaling of the Daily Mirror quoted the Jamaican superstar speaking about the Real Madrid attacker in journalist Guillem Balague's new book about the player, referencing their meeting in 2009 when CR7 was at Old Trafford: "When he is running and reaches top speed he starts to tip over. If he brought his foot down on the centre of gravity, or even in front of him, it will be much easier. He will be much better and he will go faster for longer
09/03/2017, 12:04 - Champions: To me both teams are same honestly
09/03/2017, 12:04 - Champions: I dream chelsea  overtaking both teams someday
09/03/2017, 12:04 - Akash Gore: 🤘🏻
09/03/2017, 12:04 - Champions: To win a match like yesterday.... You need to resort to penalties
09/03/2017, 12:05 - Champions: 6 goals is no joke
09/03/2017, 12:05 - Champions: So suarez has been kinda cheat since his liverpool days
09/03/2017, 12:06 - Champions: And u can understand the player's desperation to dive yesterday
09/03/2017, 12:06 - Akash Gore: Neymar's freekick n assist
09/03/2017, 12:06 - Akash Gore: They deserved it
09/03/2017, 12:06 - Champions: But ronaldo hasn't dived half to suarez and neynar is laughable
09/03/2017, 12:07 - Champions: Yea... That's the luck i talked about before...
09/03/2017, 12:07 - Champions: They could have been red
09/03/2017, 12:07 - Champions: But didn't
09/03/2017, 12:07 - Akash Gore: No luck in that..
09/03/2017, 12:07 - Akash Gore: Red for whay
09/03/2017, 12:07 - Champions: Small things like these matter
09/03/2017, 12:07 - Akash Gore: Did I miss something
09/03/2017, 12:08 - Champions: One penalty which wasn't given but then given on assistants recommendation.... Not many refrees would change their decision
09/03/2017, 12:09 - Champions: Even first 2 goals were scrambled goals....
09/03/2017, 12:09 - Champions: One own goal....
09/03/2017, 12:09 - Champions: It was their destiny
09/03/2017, 12:09 - Champions: To go to next round
09/03/2017, 12:09 - Champions: Not taking anything away from barca
09/03/2017, 12:42 - Shivprasad Nair: 2nd pen was fukat

14/03/2017, 03:36 - Srirag: Arsenal vs Man city
14/03/2017, 08:48 - Champions: With Ibrahimovic suspended, this was deemed as Rashford’s audition for a role as Manchester United’s future starting striker. But this was as much a test of the 19-year-old’s credentials as it was a screening for Pogba as the club’s next leader.

The Frenchman’s £89million valuation brought with it a list of requirements. He was expected to score goals and provide assists, to tackle, to pass, to defend and attack as the complete box-to-box midfielder.

But his main necessity, the one condition he had to consistently meet to warrant his fee, was to dominate such crucial fixtures. He did not choose the best evening to be completely overshadowed by N’Golo Kante.

Pogba had one shot, made two tackles, one interception, and completed just 27 passes. He made three unsuccessful touches, and was dispossessed eight times – more than any other player. Kante had two shots, scored one goal, made four tackles, created four goalscoring opportunities, and completed 70 passes. United pushed Chelsea as far as they could, but the midfield battle was an absolute no contest from the start.

Roy Keane - "I've never heard so much rubbish in my life. Why do we have to listen to that garbage?
It's just utter nonsense what he's talking about. He's manager of Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs on the planet. The squad he's got, the players… and he keeps moaning about fixtures and fatigue.The guy's talking absolute nonsense. I've never heard so much rubbish in my life.

'Maybe the club's too big for him. He can't deal with all these demands at the match, what matches? Man United reserves could have won that game tonight.'

18/03/2017, 19:56 - Champions: The funny aspect about arsenal fans is they are still divided whether Wenger should go or not 😆
18/03/2017, 19:59 - Sagar Kesarwani: I think Wenger is not at fault completely.....we all know what players do to get managers out
18/03/2017, 20:13 - Champions: It's honestly not the time to look at who's at fault
18/03/2017, 20:13 - Champions: We have seen what  positive impact it has when new manager new ideas come in
18/03/2017, 20:13 - Champions: So keeping club over wenger... Wenger should go
18/03/2017, 20:14 - Champions: Right now wenger is bigger than club
18/03/2017, 20:23 - Srirag: I totally respect Wenger for what he has done and the consistency that he has shown till date. But you can clearly make it out that he has lost his dressing room. They players have stopped believing him. It would be right decision for him and the club to part their ways now itself rather than it getting more worse and then sacking him.
18/03/2017, 20:24 - Champions: Board room = Wenger

Introducing AaaS *(Alcohol as a Service)*🥃

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/yourstory.com/2017/03/hipbar-startup/amp/

HipBar, allows liquor connoisseurs to buy full bottles of their favourite booze and later redeem it in any restaurant or hotel across the country. 

For example, if the connoisseur buys a bottle of expensive whisky for Rs 5,000, he can consume even a small portion of, say, 30 ml in any bar. The hotel or bar will then charge the connoisseur for the portion, which will be paid through the app. 

The app will immediately reflect a reduction in the volume of the bottle. The bottle of whisky that was purchased will stand as a prepaid instrument and its value will diminish as the customer opts to consume the whisky later on."

It is not known what was said but the defender feels he still has a future at Old Trafford.

"I am keeping my head up," he said. "I love this club and will give everything to be here.

"I am going through a phase where everything is sort of going against me. But I want this so badly. I want to prove everyone wrong.

"I score more goals than Kante but they still say Kante does this and does that. If you want to speak about scoring goals, you should judge every midfielder the same way.

27/04/2017, 19:51 - Lalit Patil: I was under impression that Chelsea fans have maximum patience to watch a game which is going nowhere.
27/04/2017, 19:52 - Champions: Have watched matches under Ancelotti?

27/04/2017, 19:56 - Lalit Patil: Why everything leads you to taking a dig at Barca bro. Best part is I don't feel bad no matter what you say about them. Chutya Hai saale😆
27/04/2017, 19:58 - Lalit Patil: I didn't even watch highlights of 7 0 match but I loved classico. 

I don't decide what I watch depending on club. I decide on level of game, I love football I don't love any club.
27/04/2017, 19:58 - Champions: Dude chelsea is not a big club... They play a certain way bcoz of their limitations... 
Financially or quality wise... 
But despite that we produced legends and some great names have graced our club 

We managed to survive and now feature in top clubs of europe... Bcoz of that strategy which u called boring. Maybe u know more about entertaining football but chelsea know more about longevity in premier league
27/04/2017, 20:03 - Lalit Patil: I get it you love Chelsea maybe because of efficiency, efficiency is your kick.

My kick is surpassing the current limit.

Which is why you like watching Chelsea and I like watching Bayern or Barca.

But you have to agree Chelsea were the pioneers of boring football, I am really happy cause they have players which can pull what they are pulling right now.
27/04/2017, 20:04 - Champions: That's the plan... To be top in europe... 
And honestly Roman is putting his own money into this now.... He doesn't care about profits. 
He always wanted club to be identified with certain brand of football
27/04/2017, 20:04 - Champions: Thankfull he's not making this into a business which other clubs like arsenal utd are doing
27/04/2017, 20:05 - Champions: He could have sold shares of club... But didn't
27/04/2017, 20:05 - Champions: The dude takes football way too seriously
27/04/2017, 20:05 - Champions: And we have a manager to match those ambitions...
27/04/2017, 20:06 - Champions: I desperately want epl dominance back in europe
